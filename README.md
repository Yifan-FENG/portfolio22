My name is Yifan Butsik (he/they). I am a designer and researcher for creative/social computing. Rooted in my social sciences and computing background, I am interested in digital technology development with cultural and gender awareness. My research reflects feminism and queer identity dynamics in human-computer interaction and addresses social and racial justice in the course of user-experience engineering.
